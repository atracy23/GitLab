    <blockquote cite="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/9810.Albert_Einstein">
        <p> “A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He
            experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical
            delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal
            desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this
            prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its
            beauty.” ― Albert Einstein
